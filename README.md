Implications of AI for Cybersecurity: Case Study on OSINT Automation.

## OSINT AI Tool

**Description**
This is an open-source tool that leverages AI techniques to perform OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tasks. It allows users to extract information from various online sources, such as social media, news articles, and public databases.

**Technologies Used**
* Python
Popular for data science and machine learning projects due to its simple syntax, large community and a large number of specialized libraries.
```
* R
```
Specialized language for statistics and data visualization, excellent for advanced statistical analysis and creation of high quality visualizations.
```
* NLTK, spaCy
```
Fundamental libraries for natural language processing (NLP), enabling tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment analysis and named entity extraction.
```

* TensorFlow, PyTorch
```
deep learning frameworks will enable the development of deep learning models for tasks such as text classification, text generation and entity recognition.
```
* Scikit-learn
``` 
Machine learning library offering a wide range of algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
```
* BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
```
Essential libraries for extracting data from web pages. BeautifulSoup is used for HTML parsing and Scrapy for large-scale scraping.
```
* Power Bi
```
Business intelligence tool to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
